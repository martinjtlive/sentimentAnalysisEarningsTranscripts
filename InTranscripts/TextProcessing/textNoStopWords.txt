results worth pointing current macro environment remains uncertain dont think im telling anyone anything people dont already know especially large purchases cars reduced prices considerably early q1 worth noting operating margin remains among best industry weve taken view pushing higher volumes larger fleet right choice versus lower volume higher margin however expect vehicles time able generate significant profit autonomy believe like laying groundwork better ship large number cars lower margin subsequently harvest margin future perfect autonomy extremely important point lets see regarding cybertruck continue build alpha versions cybertruck pilot line testing purposes great product completing installation volume production line giga texas anticipating delivery event great delivery event probably q3 new products follow curve production starts slow accelerates cybertruck different theres tremendous amount demand product obviously view fantastic product hall famer new products takes time get manufacturing line going really radical product made way cars made lets see regards megapack making great progress energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours q1 far strongest quarter ever growth achieved thanks ongoing ramp megafactory lathrop california theres still way go reach full run rates 40 gigawatt hours per year additionally announced start new megafactory shanghai weve expected stationary storage growth actually significantly exceed vehicle growth regarding autopilot full selfdriving weve crossed 150 million miles driven full selfdriving beta number growing exponentially mean data advantage really one else understand ai understand importance data training data fundamental achieving incredible outcome yes also focused improving neural net training capabilities one main limiting factors achieving full autonomy continuing simultaneously make significant purchases nvidia gpus also putting lot effort dojo believe potential order magnitude improvement cost training also dojo also potential become sellable service would offer companies way amazon web services offers web services even though started bookstore really think yes dojo

thing would say like ev materials markets theyre super liquid example like less like singledigit percentage market actually traded spot market super liquid theres like storage isnt particularly facile materials like small mismatches supply demand drive like large price swings really real price swings like temporarily large price swings hard read price wings dont know karn want add anything karn budhiraj yes well karn way seeing elon mentioned quite bit softening lithium carbonate market 6 months ago trading like 85000 ton todays spot price 26 theres dramatic decrease course able take

question elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director yes mean really 2 macro factors tricky biggest interest rate theres high fed rate interest rates high every time fed raises interest rates thats equivalent increasing price car makes cars less affordable people able buy cars function afford monthly basis thats almost directly equivalent price increase kind interest rate increase factor

youre seeing elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director well think would really love crystal ball dont depending time scale youre looking cars variable car cost variable probably guess think see improved costs suppliers yes think expectation andrew baglino senior vice president powertrain energy engineering already starting see elon think mentioned anticipated crash lithium prices flowed way lithium carbonate reductions battery cost thing happen lithium hydroxide length supply chain matters also talking far upstream time makes way battery slip car itll several months beyond commodity pricing zach mentioned earlier also focused metrics make production efficient example detention demurrage error expedites think error expedites 90 detention demurrage 93 peaks hundreds thousands dollars per vehicle sort attacking vectors becoming efficient colin william rusch oppenheimer co inc research division okay followup really around stationary storage demand utility scale mean obviously theres gigantic queue interconnection us talk volume quotation youre seeing point around stationary storage renewables sku global basis much converting actual sales elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director drew want take andrew baglino senior vice president powertrain energy engineering mean yes dont thats also exactly look really like yes engaged interconnection queue like focused ramping megapack quickly efficiently visibility pipelines variety different renewable energy pure stationary storage developers also develop projects mostly selective trying pick products projects

similar approach north america china coming quarters martin viecha senior director investor relations okay thank much lets go rod lache wolfe research rod avraham lache wolfe research llc wanted first follow comments letter leveraging cost position others struggle unit economics also taking account lifetime revenue actually way automakers never see given service network supercharging attributes maybe give us sense far youd willing take brackets around range initial margin youd comfortable color might provide updated range margins youd expect auto business elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director think may answered question tried answer question times difficult say margin depends macroeconomic environment like example fed lower rates would super helpful demand raise raises interest costs buyers pay buy car reduces affordability therefore reduces demand like look past say year like go sometime next year middle next year think things looking really think like said well weather

make easier buy cars string somewhat topic teslas think benefit think probably theres benefit yes adam michael jonas morgan stanley research division get elon followup manufacturing youre student history youll note back 1913 henry ford introduced moving assembly line highland park michigan price model already undercutting cars around time fell another 70 80 hundreds rival car companies went bust im wondering history repeating elon recent pattern cuts way ahead cost curve compared competition seems like calculated strategy reaction competition changing supplydemand market could catalyze darwinian forces ev market elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director well mean trying say take pricing actions order deliberately deliberately undermine competitors anything like really dont think competitors much look people like cars make product better afford cars sort things like improving service whatnot id say unique strategic advantage making car autonomy pans think asset actually worth hell lot future technically possible sell 0 profit still net present value future cash flows associated asset significant adam michael jonas morgan stanley research division service charging insurance ongoing revenue streams companies dont elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director yes andrew baglino senior vice president powertrain energy engineering certainly want evs succeed want say like

technoking tesla ceo director yes mean could like obviously macro shock severe people stop buying cars reason absence continue grow output rapid clip dan meir levy barclays bank plc research division great margins associated austin berlin mentioned austin berlin margin drag reach intended volumes dont know disclose volumes maybe could remind us margin profile austin berlin look like versus shanghai get vertical integration benefits place elon r musk technoking tesla ceo director well probably 12 quite good shanghai hard efficient cost structures obviously lowest cost structure world
